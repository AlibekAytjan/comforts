Comforts is a mod that adds sleeping bags and hammocks to Minecraft. These items can be used just like beds except they do not set a player's spawn point on use, safely preserving a player's spawn point at their home base. Just like beds, they also come in 16 different colors! The difference is that sleeping bags can be stacked and are more convenient to use on adventures and hammocks are like an inverse bed, turning day to night.

## Features
### Sleeping Bag
The recipe for the sleeping bag is simply three pieces of matching color wool in a straight line.

You can also dye a regular White Sleeping Bag into any of the other colors!

### Hammock
The recipe for the hammock cloth is simply a piece of colored wool in the center, sticks to the top and bottom, and the rest of the slots are strings.
